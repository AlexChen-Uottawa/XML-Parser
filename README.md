XML Parser
================================

To build the toolkit: see `./INSTALL`.  These instructions are valid for UNIX
systems including various flavors of Linux; Darwin; and Cygwin (has not been
tested on more "exotic" varieties of UNIX). And Windows.

To run the example system build under root directory:

Command:
./bin/parse-xml-configuration fuelLynxConfig.xml
